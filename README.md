# Java Calculator

This is an enhanced version of a simple calculator built using Java. The calculator supports multiple mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation (power), square root, logarithms (base 10), and factorial calculation. The program offers a user-friendly interface and robust error handling.

## Features

- **Basic operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Advanced operations**: 
  - Power (A^B or B^A).
  - Square Root (of A or B).
  - Logarithm (base 10) of A or B.
  - Factorial of a number.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Handles division by zero.
  - Prevents square root of negative numbers.
  - Prevents logarithm of non-positive numbers.
- **User-friendly menu** for selecting operations.
- **Multiple operations in one session**: Perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
  
## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java version 8 or later installed on your machine.
  
### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EnhancedJavaCalculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd EnhancedJavaCalculator
    ```

3. Compile the `EnhancedCalculator.java` file:

    ```bash
    javac EnhancedCalculator.java
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```bash
    java EnhancedCalculator
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

## Example Usage

1. Start the program and enter the first number.
2. Enter the second number.
3. Choose an operation from the menu:
   - 1 for Addition (+)
   - 2 for Subtraction (-)
   - 3 for Multiplication (ร)
   - 4 for Division (รท)
   - 5 for Power (a^b)
   - 6 for Square Root
   - 7 for Logarithm (log10)
   - 8 for Factorial
4. The program will show the result and ask if you want to perform another calculation.
